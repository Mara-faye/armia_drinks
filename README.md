# Drinks animated Be Right Back page

Very barebones and hacky way to deliver an animation that will show random cocktails as requested

Config variable in `brb_anim.js` allows for easy adjustment
- demoName: Dummy Twitch username
- mainloopDelay: Wait time before demo animation
- arrowsSpeed: Arrow animation speed. Lower is faster
- arrowsDelay: Wait time between arrow animations
- ribbonSpeed: Text scroll speed for tablet ribbon text. Higher is slower

`?un=requester_username` for passing a variable requester, otherwise will default to dummy

### TO-DO
- ~~Variable username~~ 
- ~~Animated arrows~~
- ~~Audio elements~~
- ~~Tablet text~~
- Different presentation in Attract Mode vs. Request
- Separate alert version that will go on top of other scenes
- Ability to specify cocktail?
