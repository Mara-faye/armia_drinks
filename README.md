# Drinks animated Be Right Back page

Very barebones and hacky way to deliver an animation that will show random cocktails as requested

Should have an easier to manage config file before it's ready for delivery, variables will be detailed HERE

`?un=requester_username` for passing a variable requester, otherwise will default to dummy

### TO-DO
- ~~Variable username~~ 
- Animated arrows
- Audio elements
- Tablet text
- Different presentation in Attract Mode vs. Request
- Separate alert version that will go on top of other scenes
- Ability to specify cocktail?
